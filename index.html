<li>Zodiac Sign: L10:51 PM 3/27/2021eo</li>
<li>Student Number: s3909043</li>
<li>Student Email Address: s3909043@student.rmit.edu.au </li>
<li>Background information: Vietnamese, born in Australia. Fluent in both English and Vietnamese</li>
<li>Education to date: Completed Year 12 VCE in 2017, started a Bachelor of Business majoring in Accounting at Swinburne University for 2 years after high school but realized accounting was not for me so I decided to withdraw and study a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT instead.</li>
<li>Fact about me: I went through my first heartbreak at the start of this year, 2021. It was and still is a painful yet worthy experience. I have known this girl for about a year, gained a lot of closeness and familiarity with her, it was long distance but was nevertheless a great and memorable experience. Nothing particularly bad happened, I learnt a lot, cried a lot and am still trying to forget her.</li>

<h3>My Interest in IT</h3>
<h4>How, what and when (my interest in IT)?</h4>
<p>I became interested in IT due to a subject I did in high school, Cert III. In Digital Media and Information Technology. This subject was on-going for 3 years to obtain the full certificate, I had completed the full duration and naturally my interest in IT started in Year 10 of high school (2015). I thoroughly enjoyed this subject, found it really easy and enjoyable to do especially with some of my high school friends who also participated. 
<br></br>An experience I had while doing this subject was, an excursion to PwC. To be honest I was more focused on having fun with my friends rather than being curious and touring the place properly. This may have been my only experience with IT, but I did not fully take advantage and cherish this excursion.
<br></br>Although IT was not my first preference after completing high school, I have ultimately decided to come back to IT from accounting. I wasted a lot of time studying accounting, 2 years to be exact, a field which I really did not like. So far, my time in this Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT has been pleasant and I am very glad to have switched from accounting to IT.</p>
<h4>Why RMIT?</h4>
<p>
I chose to study at RMIT solely because of the campus’ dispersed Melbourne City location. The previous university that I attended while I was studying accounting was Swinburne University of Technology, although I could have swapped into IT at Swinburne, I decided RMIT would be better as, the commuting time to Swinburne was too long. It was lengthy due to being in the opposite direction that I lived in and a little further past the Melbourne city.
<br></br>I also wanted to use the opportunity for studying at RMIT to explore and familiarize myself with the Melbourne City more as I rarely have the chance to visit and explore the very own city, I was birthed in. This, however, is now all ironic as I took too long to decide that I wanted to study IT at RMIT and so I have applied quite late this year (2021), the only classes that were available for me to enroll into was online classes. This makes me a little bit sad as I would have much preferred-on campus classes, but I guess it cannot be helped, I am very much looking forward to my classes next semester though!</p>
<h4>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h4>
<p>
I expect to learn, remember and utilize some programming skills along with gaining some experience with popular software used commonly by IT companies. I expect at least this much because in my mind, this is essentially what I would need to feel ready for a career in the IT industry after I graduate. Aside from IT skills I would also like to substantially build on my social skills as I believe networking is very important when it comes to working with colleagues and creating opportunities for myself in the future. If I had the choice I would rather work alone, but if need be, I’d like to be able to have the appropriate skills to work with a team.</p>

<h3>My Ideal Job</h3>

<h4>What is my ideal job?</h4>
<img src="images/idealjob.png" alt="Ideal Job" style="float:right;width:380px;">
<p>
The Database Administrator position is currently the job I am aiming for. As for why and what makes it my ideal job as of now; I am enjoying my first year IT database unit and the snapshot of the advertised job comes with a decent salary which piques my interest.</p>
<h4>What skills would I need?</h4>
<p>
A lot of experience and familiarity with the software that is listed in the advertisement. Such as: MS SQL, Oracle databases, MS Windows & Linux, AWS, MS Azure cloud. Along with professional written and verbal communication skills.</p>
<h4>What skills do I currently possess?</h4>
<p>
I currently possess very basic SQL skills, gained from the 4 weeks I’ve been studying in my IT degree. But I’ve learnt a lot about Microsoft Access and Excel during my Cert III. in IT class that spanned over 3 years of my high school, I would hope that the skills I learnt during that would be of some use.</p>
<h4>How will I obtain the skills needed for this ideal position?</h4>
<p>
Complete my Bachelors in IT degree at RMIT and gain experience through various internships/ junior/ graduate positions, that have some sort of relation to any database systems, not just specific to the job advertisement as I believe the more exposure, with any database program, the merrier and easier it will be for me to adjust and learn the required operations of database software required for my ideal job.</br>

<h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
<p>
These test results are a general representation of my personality and learning style. They are an attempt to display my traits as an individual or even score them. Also, my preferred method of learning style is amongst these test results. I mostly agree with the results that were given to me, but something that surprised me was the 16personalities Myers-Briggs test. When I took the test previously, I had received the Defender (ISFJ) as my personality type, and I would have to agree with the Defender personality as more fitting for me personally, I wonder if going through a break-up has changed my personality drastically.</p>
<h4>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h4>
<p>These test results tell me that I am not fit to be a leader. That will affect how I will behave in a team as if this thought is put into my mind, I would not perform any actions that would mistake me as being the team’s leader. Suggesting and initiating is not my cup of tea, along with managing team members and taking the rein on which direction the team should head in will definitely not be coming from me. </p>
<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
<p>When forming a team, I should try my best to display my diligence, consistent and hardworking attributes so that I am able to at least trigger some attraction for people who would want me in a group. As I am not willing to be the ‘leader’ of a group, the best I can do is show off my good qualities and hopefully have someone reach out to me and have me be a part of their group. Taking the results of my personality into account, my team should know that I am very introverted, prefer to work alone and therefore may take time to open up, suggest ideas and create conversation.</p>

<h3>Project Idea</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
The project will be a phone app where users are able to rate their local retail supermarket snacks, generating a platform where peoples’ opinions on how tasty a snack is, and their preferred brand will help others decide when making their purchase. The project will require application developing and programming skills in order to get the ball rolling. In the following paragraphs of text, we will discover and go through why this project is useful, it’s features, the software/hardware needed for it to function, the skills that will be needed to make this project come to life and the possible added benefits/ impacts this project will have post-creation/release.</p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>As I, for one myself, believe that going to the supermarket isn’t as simple as fetching groceries, buying whole ingredients and necessary everyday essential needs products. Obviously, shopping for these things are important but outside of those, buying snacks can be part of an everyday consumers’ purpose when they visit a supermarket. Myself, I am a very undecisive person and can never decide on which snacks/ brand of snacks I want, I thought of this project in hopes of gathering a small snack-loving community to suggest/offer their opinions/feedback through a snack-rating app that would assist their fellow snack-lovers when purchasing a certain sweet, crave quenching snack.
</p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Purpose
<br></br>
In order to save others time by having snacks at retail stores be rated by everyday consumers, I have decided to go with this project and attempt to make it as simple and easy to use as possible. This app will ensure that consumers won’t have to go out of their way to taste test every single brand of every single snack, there are just simply way too many brands of the same flavored snack and it would be rather tedious to go through them all. 
<br></br>There are also very limited information on how these certain snacks taste if an everyday consumer just walks into the supermarket. The information on the certain products’ packaging, in my opinion, is not nearly enough to satisfy ones’ curiosity on how it tastes. I have also had a look online, when searching for a product through a retailers’ website, you are not able to gain any reviews or ratings on the product. Instead, a detailed google search on the specific product along with the word review after it, will pull up results that I would consider somewhat passable, but a hassle to do. This app is a product but also a service that will hopefully enable consumers to not have to rely on their own personal experience with certain brands/ products, leading them to purchase the same product over and over, not venture out into something new and possibly better.
<br></br>Features
<br></br>
I am thinking that just a number rating is not enough, and therefore have decided to not only go with a number rating, but the app should also display a short description of how it tastes, or how it was prepared to achieve such a rating and any products/brands that would rival or has a similar taste to this product that the user was reviewing/ giving a rating.
<br></br>Interface
<br></br>
For this app we will be going with a simplistic and easy to navigate-interface which will greatly attract users to give the app a go, therefore I will attempt to make it as minimalistic and clutter-free as possible to make it feasible to users of any age group, background and level of knowledge to phone apps.
I thought about making this a personalized profile based kind of app, where you can save certain products for later use but I gave it some more thought and I think this will make the app too complicated, and lets be honest, after viewing a product once and trying it out for oneself, I believe would be enough to engrave into ones’ memory; how a certain product tasted, if it satisfied their taste buds and matched what they were looking for. 
Upon opening the app, a simple search bar will appear, which will imply “search for the product you’re after”. Along with a simple search bar, an option to categorize products and simple filtering system would greatly benefit narrowing down search results and just general catering to the user’s needs.</p>
<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
<p>At an obvious glance, the hardware that will be required will be a functioning mobile phone with a working internet connection. However, to create this app, a PC will be required in the process of making the app. The software that could possibly, commonly and is popularly used based off of a quick google search are: Apple Pie, BuildFire, Appian, Appery.io and BiznessApps. These software were listed as the best mobile app development software options, they are listed as the best as they are simple to use, require little-no coding and are just the perfect fit we are looking for when looking to develop a minimalistic app.</p>
<h4>Skills Required</h4>
<p>To be brutally honest, obtaining the skills to develop a simple app like this should not be too great of a task. It has a simple interface, and the only difficult part is getting the app to function properly with great accuracy and speed. The software needed can be obtained online, the mobile app developer softwares listed in the previous section are mostly paid but some come with a free trial and I believe they are a good suit for making a decent application that can satisfy and make this project become true.</p>
<h4>Potential Drawbacks or Obstacles</h4>
<p>Gathering users for this app may prove to be quite a difficult task. Depending on how its advertised post release and it’s general functionality will be the backbone to making this app work. Many users will be required for this app as there needs to be a majority rules sort of rating system, and it wouldn’t hurt to have many opinions as they will serve as the foundation to seeking the best possible snack. Having more users will establish consistency and a more accurate rating, which is crucial as there are many different taste buds and ensuring that the best possible suggestion/recommendation is not severely inaccurate would be in the best interests for this project.</p>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>The outcome that this project would have if it were to be successful would provide the general public with access to an optional product/ service that would assist them in decision making when it comes to snack purchasing. Saving their time and helping undecisive people with their snack choices, enabling a happy snacking session and appreciation for the existence of this app. A simple yet somewhat effective idea that I have yet seen or know of on the market, I’d like to see more projects that would obtain similar results of convenience as this one.
